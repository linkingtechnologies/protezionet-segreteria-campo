Changelog

0.6

	- New methods get row attrs() and set row attr() enable the developer to hide application
	  specific row attributes inside the row structure. These attributes are always available and
	  tightly binded to the row, allowing the developer to implement special features. See example
	  Using OS3Grid to Edit a Dataset for an advenced demo.

	- New method get col attrs() enables the developer to inspect cell information.

	- New method length() returns the number of rows inside the OS3Grid .

	- Added some new public functions: os3grid get grid() returns a valid pointer to a OS3Grid
	  by its unique id name and os3grid set cell value() allows the developer to set a cell
	  value by providing the full id and the cell value.

	  NOTE: public functions are always prefixed os3grid_.

	- Column renderer functions (those set using the set col render() method) now can have
	  a new, optional, parameter full id, that identify the OS3Grid cell uniquely. See example
	  Advanced Cell Value Manipulation for a demo.

	- A new Advenced Examples section has been added. For real life uses of OS3Grid , you should
	  have a look to these examples.

	- Documentation has been improved with "What's New" section, allowing the "old-time" OS3Grid
	  developer to know what has changed at a glance. Also, the new section Public Functions has
	  been added to document OS3Grid public functions.

	- From this version, OS3Grid will start making extensive use of the full id, an attribute that
	  was always present but never used outside OS3Grid internal functions.

0.5	Column Resize and Renderers,  start_counter attribute

	- This version of OS3Grid offers two new exciting features: the ability for the user to
	  resize columns interactively and column renderers to change column data before it is
	  output to the Grid.
	  Also, the new attribute ``start_counter`` will let the programmer define which is the first
	  row number to be shown (just a counter, all the rows will be output as usual).

	- Documentation has been updated to cover these new features.

	- Two new examples has been added to show new OS3Grid capabilities.

	- CSS and examples have been updated to work better on Internet Explorer.

0.4	Internet Explorer Fixes and Docs enhancements

	This version of OS3Grid mainly focuses on bug fixes and documentation enhancements.
	A blocking bug preventing the cell editing functions has been fixed. 
	Many small issues with Internet Explorer has been fixed as well.

	Documentation now covers all OS3Grid APIs and introduces the new styling system.

0.3	Reaching perfection :-)

	NEW: new methods:

		- set_col_type ( col, type )	Allows the developer to describe the column type. This hint will
						be used to sort column and to align in the right way.

		- get_row ( row_num )		Returns an array with all the values of row ``row_num``

		- set_click_cb ( col, callback ) Sets the function to be called when the user clicks on the column header.
						 Pass -1 to make a column unclickable.

	     new attributes:

	     	- filter_args			This is a T/F flag. If T, input to add_row() will be filtered and all 
						single quotes chars (') will be replaced with the "&apos;" entity.
	

0.2	Minor bugfix and work in progress

	NEW: new methods: 

		- show_row_num ( show ):	If ``show`` is true, then the grid will show row numbers on the left.
		- set_row_select ( flag ):	If ``flag`` is true, the user is able to select a row by simply click
						on the row number (this implies ``show_row_num()`` to true )
						NOTE: this option does NOT work yet.

	ENH: To edit a cell, the user now needs to double click on it. This permits to have both cell-edit and
	     single cell selection at once (before this, the ``onclick`` event could just be binded to one single
	     event preventing the other to occur).

	DEL: set_editable_size() is now deprecated and no alternate way is provided because now OS3Grid set the right
	     editable size automatically. A JavaScript alert() will popup in your code if you are using this
	     method. Please, remove it from your code since, starting from the next release (0.2.1 or 0.3) the method 
             will be removed from the OS3Grid class.

	FIX: Now OS3Grid does not try to sort rows if user has not selected one sort column first.
	FIX: Removed some potential JavaScript code errors, detected using the "JavaScript strict" option in Mozilla.

0.1.1	FIX: small bug that prevent IExplorer to sort rows
