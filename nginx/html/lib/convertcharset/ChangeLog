/**
 * -- ChangeLog --
 *
 * -- Version 1.1 2007-10-30 --
 *
 * - Main change is about speed increse (about 24x ;-) )
 * - New ConvertArray() method which will convert whole milti-dimentional array values into proper encoding.
 * - "Small" class file, and "full" one with comments etc.
 *
 * <code>
 * BE CAREFUL WITH UPGRADE!!! - CONSTRUCTOR HAS CHANGED!!!
 * </code>
 *
 * Because of different constructor initialisation, we get great speed increse.
 * In version 1.1 you decide about parameters before convertion. This can take more memory, but is much faster then
 * constructing convert arrays every time you call Convert() method.
 *
 * Right now you should create as many objects as many conversions you need.
 * Then convert every string with proper object.
 * <code>
 * <?php
 * ...
 * require_once(ConvertCharset.class.php);
 * ...
 * $iso2win = new ConvertCharset ('iso-8859-2','windows-1250');
 * $win2iso = new ConvertCharset ('windows-1250','iso-8859-2');
 * $iso2dos = new ConvertCharset ('iso-8859-2','cp852');
 * ...
 * $string_iso = 'something in iso-8859-2';
 * $string_win = 'something in windows-1250';
 * ...
 * $new_win = $iso2win->Convert($string_iso);
 * $new_iso = $win2iso->Convert($string_win);
 * $new_dos = $iso2dos->Convert($string_iso);
 * ...
 * ?>
 * </code>
 *
 *
 * -- Version 1.0 2004-07-28 --
 *
 * I want to thank all people who helped me fix all bugs, small and big once.
 * I hope that you don't mind that your names are in this file.
 *
 * -- Some Apache issues --
 * I get info from Lukas Lisa, that in some cases with special apache configuration
 * you have to put header() function with proper encoding to get your result
 * displayed correctly.
 * If you want to see what I mean, go to demo.php and demo1.php
 *
 * -- Version BETA 1.0 2003-10-21 --
 * This was initial release ;-)
